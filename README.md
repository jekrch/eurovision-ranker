[Eurovision Ranker](https://www.eurovision-ranker.com/) is a web application for creating, sharing, and analyzing rankings of Eurovision Song Contest participants.

A user's ranking is stored in the URL so it can be easily saved for later reference or shared with friends. [React Joyride](https://react-joyride.com/) is used to provide a tour that demos other features: e.g. generating YouTube playlists and exploring official voting results from previous years.

Users can also view a geographical heat map of their ranking, which is implemented using [React Simple Maps](https://www.react-simple-maps.io/).

Multiple rankings can be created by category with different weights given to each category to reflect the user's preferences. A weighted total ranking can then be calculated, which reflects the competing values contributing to the user's final judgment.

## Pairwise Comparison Sorter

Want to rank contestants from different years side-by-side? Eurovision Ranker includes a smart sorter tool:

*   **Pick Any Mix:** Select any group of contestants you want to compare, regardless of the year they competed.
*   **Simple Choices:** The tool shows you two contestants at a time, and you simply pick your preference.
*   **Efficient Ranking:** Based on your choices, the sorter infers other relationships. For example, if you prefer A over B, and B over C, it learns you prefer A over C *without asking again*. This process minimizes the number of comparisons needed to generate your complete, personalized ranking for the selected group.

This lets you create rankings that accurately reflect your preferences in a quick and simple way.
